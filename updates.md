3/21: 

Read in the .csv data set on beers and breweries, that I found on GitHub. Decided I needed to figure out how to get Latitude and Longitude for the cities so that I can map the breweries in the shiny app. Recieved the suggestion to join directly from the beers dataset we used for class.

3/23: beginning of class

Read in the data and found a city data csv. Put these two into a set data set and a leaflet. Printed leaflet and a changing table by city into the shiny app. No problems so far.
