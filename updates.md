3/21: 

Read in the .csv data set on beers and breweries, that I found on GitHub. Decided I needed to figure out how to get Latitude and Longitude for the cities so that I can map the breweries in the shiny app. Recieved the suggestion to join directly from the beers dataset we used for class.

3/23: beginning of class

Read in the data and found a city data csv. Put these two into a set data set and a leaflet. Printed leaflet and a changing table by city into the shiny app. No problems so far. 

3/23: after-class

Added a new tab and a title to my shiny app and made a stagnant lollipop plot that shows all styles and each beers alcohol content, as well as the mean ABV for each style. Have to figure out how to get a title on my table and get the leaflet to zoom as you choose.
