3/21: 

Read in the .csv data set on beers and breweries, that I found on GitHub. Decided I needed to figure out how to get Latitude and Longitude for the cities so that I can map the breweries in the shiny app. Recieved the suggestion to join directly from the beers dataset we used for class.

Read in the data and found a city data csv. Put these two into a set data set and a leaflet. Printed leaflet and a changing table by city into the shiny app. No problems so far. 

3/23: after-class

Added a new tab and a title to my shiny app and made a stagnant lollipop plot that shows all styles and each beers alcohol content, as well as the mean ABV for each style. Have to figure out how to get a title on my table and get the leaflet to zoom as you choose.

Added another lollipop plot for IBU by style and put my ABV lollipop plot into shiny. Worked on the issues of a reactive title for my table and zooming in on the plot when the city is selected, but did not find solutions. For today, I want to make conditional axis labels so the user can pick the response variable for the lollipop plots.
