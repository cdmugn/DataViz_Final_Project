3/21: Claire Dudley 

- Comparing success of teams in the NHL before and after the trade deadline for 2017-2018. Data set assembled from SYE, converting to a shiny app interface. Biggest hold up for her is that the plots are hard coded for regression models, and need to be converted to be shiny accessible. 

3/23: Jack Sylvia

- Doing baseball stats for different teams and fields in St. Lawrence League, wants to make shiny app with the field shapes as visuals and the team stats as the numbers. Recommended I title my table and that I have the cities you choose communicate with the leaflet map.
